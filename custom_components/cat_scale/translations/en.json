Set to your cat's average weight minus 20–30%.\n• Minimum presence time: The minimum time (in seconds) the cat must be present to count as a visit. Use your cat's average litterbox time minus 10–20%.\n• Leave timeout: Time (in seconds) after the cat leaves before ending the visit. Increase if your cat often returns quickly.\n• After-cat standard deviation: Used to detect when the weight has stabilized after a visit. Default is usually fine.\n\nFor more details, see the README: https://github.com/djbios/home-assistant-cat-scale?tab=readme-ov-file#algorithm-overview",
